Adding notes to each sniped device (add emojis) 
At the end of each snoop, can you presen the useer with a list to pick between each of the scanned devices....
For each device, the information should be preseneted in a list format with the manufacturer and the OUI and the GPS coords..
The items should be selectable. When selected, the user is presented with a menu of options:
  1. Add Note (text input)
  2. View Note (display existing note)
  3. Delete Note (confirm deletion)
  4. View Location on Map (opens a map with GPS coords)
  5. Exit to Device List

- Use a public OUI database (like the IEEE OUI list) to map MAC address prefixes to manufacturers.
- You can find the OUI database here: https://standards-oui.ieee.org

- GPS tagging
