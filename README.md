# bluesnoop
A simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sniffer using Python and the Bleak library

#### Grant Bluetooth Permissions
Since you are using iTerm2, you need to ensure the terminal itself has permission to "snoop" on Bluetooth.
Open System Settings (or System Preferences).
Go to `Privacy & Security > Bluetooth.`

#### Getting Started
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install asyncio bleak rich manuf bluetooth-numbers
python3 bluesnoop.py
```

```
An Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) is a 24-bit (three-byte) number, managed by the IEEE, that uniquely identifies a manufacturer or organization for network devices, forming the first half of a device's MAC address to ensure global uniqueness 
```

The uuid.UUID class in Python strictly validates strings against the RFC 4122 standard. Specifically, it looks for a "version" digit at a specific position in the string.

Why it's failing
In a standard UUID, the first digit of the third group (e.g., xxxx-xxxx-**N**xxx-xxxx) must be a number from 1 to 5 (representing the version).

Looking at your data:

D5D93B6E-C324-**F**D7B... -> The version digit is F.

6ADBBD89-CBFF-**0**FE8... -> The version digit is 0.

Since F and 0 are not valid RFC 4122 versions (1-5), Python throws a ValueError: badly formed hexadecimal UUID string.
