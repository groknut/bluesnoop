A simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sniffer using Python and the Bleak library. \
Main repository: [Bluesnoop](https://github.com/ANG13T/bluesnoop)

## Features 
- Identify nearby device UUIDs and names
- Persistent tracking of first and last appearance
- Translation of cryptic model IDs
- Export intelligence for external analysis

## Getting Started

#### Grant Bluetooth Permissions
If you are using iTerm2, you need to ensure the terminal itself has permission to Bluetooth. \
Open System Settings (or System Preferences). \
Go to `Privacy & Security > Bluetooth` and *Grant Access* to **iTerm2**.

```bash
uv sync
uv run bluesnoop.py
```

## Contributing
bluesnoop is open to any contributions. Please fork the repository and make a pull request with the features or fixes you want to be implemented.

### Interpreting Bluetooth UUID && OUID Numbers
  
- Use a public OUI database (like the IEEE OUI list) to map MAC address prefixes to manufacturers.
- You can find the OUI database here: https://standards-oui.ieee.org

```
An Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) is a 24-bit (three-byte) number, managed by the IEEE, that uniquely identifies a manufacturer or organization for network devices, forming the first half of a device's MAC address to ensure global uniqueness 
```

The uuid.UUID class in Python strictly validates strings against the RFC 4122 standard. Specifically, it looks for a "version" digit at a specific position in the string.

Why it's failing
In a standard UUID, the first digit of the third group (e.g., xxxx-xxxx-**N**xxx-xxxx) must be a number from 1 to 5 (representing the version).

Looking at your data:

`D5D93B6E-C324-**F**D7B...` -> The version digit is `F`.

`6ADBBD89-CBFF-**0**FE8...` -> The version digit is `0`.

Since F and 0 are not valid RFC 4122 versions (1-5), Python throws a ValueError: badly formed hexadecimal UUID string.
